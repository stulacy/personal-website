Related to my [previous blog post](http://stuartlacy.co.uk/2013/05/05/website-update-in-the-works/) about updating this website, it appears that my current web host don't offer Python support. This means that until I have the time and energy, this website will still be run by php. This isn't a big issue but I do want to use Python for everything I can as it is such a brilliant language.

Looking at php CMS options it seems that Drupal will be best for me, it may be a little overkill for just a personal website but it'll be good to know for the future!
