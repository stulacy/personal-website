It's gradually getting closer to the three year PhD deadline in which I intend to submit, meaning I've got two and a half months to not only finish up my experiments but write up my entire thesis. To help motivate myself to work on this huge document (and definitely not as a form of procrastination) I've started recording my writing progress and am publicly displaying the data [here](http://www.stuartlacy.co.uk/thesisprogress/progress.html). The idea is that I won't want people (family, supervisors, colleagues) to notice that I'm slacking. Also it's given me a good opportunity to practice some web data visualisation tools, in particular I'm using the popular JavaScript [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com) library. While it looks nice, it isn't as easy to use as the standard offline tools I use, and it doesn't provide much in the way of manipulating data. For future such work I'd be tempted to experiment with [Shiny](http://www.shiny.rstudio.com) which provides an interactive interface to R. However for that I'd need full control of the server which I currently don't have.

I haven't written anything in the last three weeks as I've been running a lot (~200k) experiments that will comprise the bulk of the data for my thesis, as you can imagine running such a number of simulations takes considerable computational time. Once I've got these results underway I should be able to write up the methodology as well as substantial data analysis. These results will also indicate to me whether my current hypothesis is looking to be true.
