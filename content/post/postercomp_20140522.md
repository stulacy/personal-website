As part of the PhD programme we have to produce a poster in our second year which are then judged by the head of the research groups. It was the first poster I've done so wasn't too sure about things such as layout, font size etc... but it turned out pretty well in the end, and even won the second prize so was very happy with that! It's a brief summary of some of the work I've been doing over the last 18 months, I decided to focus on the Parkinson's Disease research as that's more interesting to the layman rather than my current ensemble work. See a scaled down bitmap below.
