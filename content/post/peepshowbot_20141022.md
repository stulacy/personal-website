After watching Peep Show recently I realised there just isn't enough of it in my life. The writing is a particular highlight, with brilliant characters (that are somewhat relatable) and each episode is filled with hilarious quotes. If you haven't seen it before I highly recommended checking it out on Netflix, which has all 8 seasons. Each season is only 6 episodes long so it won't take long to watch them all. As a result of wanting more Peep Show in my life, and the welcome news that it will be <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/peep-show-to-end-next-year-after-ninth-series-8839861.html">returning for a final 9th season</a>, I created a small script to send me a new Peep Show quote each day. Initially it was sent by email, but after my recent experience with the Twitter API I decided to make a Twitter account dedicated to Peep Show Quotes, found here <a href="https://twitter.com/DailyPeepshow">https://twitter.com/DailyPeepshow</a>. It's got a database of 360 quotes so it will be a year before they start repeating. I may increase the frequency they are tweeted to twice a day but for now they are tweeted at midday everyday.
