I've never fully taught myself R, just dipped in and out when necessary. I've primarily used it for standard data analysis and visualisation, although I have been meaning to get to grips with one of the numerous available machine learning packages. Dealing with datasets tends to involve a lot of hacky manipulation until it's in a useful format for your analysis. Initially I was just trying to use standard library functions, although once I came upon the essential <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/index.html">reshape2 package</a> and the ease with which you could convert your dataframe between wide and long formats I knew I was going to have to use a different approach. I also spent a while trying to understand all the ways of doing split-apply-combine functions in core R, although after getting confused with aggregate and the <a href="https://nsaunders.wordpress.com/2010/08/20/a-brief-introduction-to-apply-in-r/">apply family</a> I just wished for a single function which worked well with dataframes, as that was all that I was using. I found the answer to my problems in the form of the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html">plyr</a> package, which contains all kind of useful functions for summarising datasets. Having seen that both of these last 2 packages were authored by the renowned <a href="http://had.co.nz/">Hadley Wickham</a>, who has also produced the <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">ggplot2</a> plotting library (which in my opinion looks better and is more user friendly than the standard R lattice module), I've decided to learn his ecosystem (the so-called _Hadleyverse_) rather than than using the core R library for basic data munging for now.

Hadley has released an update to `plyr` only last year, which introduces not only a simplified set of functions and promises better performance, but introduces a piping operator into the mix. This allows for very similar code to using `ggplot2`, and as you'd expect from sharing a common author, they interact beautifully. Have a look at this <a href="http://www.sharpsightlabs.com/dplyr-intro-data-manipulation-with-r/">overview</a> of the main functions from `dplyr` if this interests you. On their own they aren't much use, but when piped together and in tandem with `ggplot2` they allow for very quick data analysis and visualisation with a very readable syntax.
