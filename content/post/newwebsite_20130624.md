As an update to the [last post](http://stuartlacy.co.uk/2013/06/21/drupal-wins/), in pretty much just a day I've gotten my website configured with Drupal and it's much the same as before. As [previously mentioned](http://stuartlacy.co.uk2013/05/05/website-update-in-the-works/), I had essentially developed my own CMS originally, which provided very similar functionality to what I'm getting from Drupal now. However now it is much easier to make any changes as I don't need to mess around with the code, and more importantly, the website is far more robust now. It's been extremely useful getting to learn a CMS and I haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg as Drupal has a vast amount of features for the advanced user. This will come in handy however for any future projects.

For the meantime however I still need to tidy up this site and add a few things in here and there.
