I've finally managed to combine my two main hobbies of data science and running into one project: a Shiny web-app that allows you to explore your Strava fitness data, as well as providing a local database of all your activities that you can analyse with R.

My initial motivation was that I wanted quick access to certain visualisations and metrics that either Strava doesn't provide, or are awkward to get so I wrote a basic app for my own use.
However, I then realised that there almost certainly would be others who would value from this work, either from the app itself or the infrastructure to create and maintain a local database of your Strava data, and I decided to open it up.
I stuck with the local route of everyone installing (and customising!) their own Shiny app, rather than me hosting a central version in the Cloud as I strongly feel that everyone should have complete ownership of their own data. 

TL;DR: Install from [GitHub](https://github.com/stulacy/StravaR)

## App functionality

The app itself looks as below, with the main page providing a quick GitHub-style calendar showing activities in the last year, along with an interactive table of all activities, which I find far quicker to search for a specific activity than the Strava website.

**NB: the 'Activity Type' checkbox on the left allows you choose which sports are shown for this page and all pages.**
By default this is set to Runs only but you can change in the settings (cog icon in the top right).

The main metric that guides my training programs is my mileage, so I want to be able to see at a glance both how my weekly mileage is doing, and also how my year-to-date cumulative load compares with previous years.

I like being aware of my heart-rate stress score based training load too, which is the same metric used in the [Elevate](https://thomaschampagne.github.io/elevate/#/landing) extension.

The final page displays an interactive map of all activities.
When I'm not in a specific training cycle, my main motivation (especially during the winter!) comes from exploring new routes.
One feature I'd like to add is the calculation of what percent of runs in a specified area you have run on, watch this space...

## Uploading data

On first use, you will be prompted to upload an exported archive from Strava containing all your data.
This can be downloaded from the (deliberately?) confusingly named page [Delete Your Account (NB: this link WILL NOT delete your account!)](https://www.strava.com/athlete/delete_your_account).
If you don't want to click that scary link, in a web browser click your Profile Pic in the top right, Settings, My Account, scroll down to Download or Delete Your Account and click Get Started. Your archive will be emailed to you shortly

## Linking to Strava

For subsequent use you can either continue the tedious manual process of requesting archives, waiting for the email, and uploading it, or you can directly link your account to Strava through the API.
You'll need to create an App through [Strava's developer scheme](https://www.strava.com/settings/api) and substitute the Client ID and Secret in the line `STRAVA_APP <- oauth_app(...)` in `server.R` as the `key` and `secret` arguments respectively.
Then you are good to go by clicking the Connect With Strava button in the top right!

**Why can't I just use your key and secret?**
Because the `oauth 2.0` authentication method used by the Strava API isn't ideal for Desktop Apps (as in those that get installed to each users' computer, rather than running a single instance in the Cloud), as there's no way of installing the app without making the key and secret accessible to the user.
These values are considered sensitive because anyone could use them to make you think you were authorising your Strava account to connect to my app, but in reality they get access to your data.
I didn't want to write a Cloud based app as I'd rather everyone be able to own and manage their own data, rather than hand it off to yet another third party!

## Database

The app creates a [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/) database to store your data, which is an embedded database designed for analytics (i.e. it is column-based compared to SQLite's row-based), this saved in the working directory as `data.db`.
It supports querying through standard SQL commands, see the [documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/api/r.html), although it is much easier to interface to it using the fantastic [dbplyr package](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) which allows you to use standard `tidyverse` functions instead.

For example, to load all your activities you would do the following:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(duckdb)

# Connect to the database
con <- dbConnect(duckdb(), "data.db")

tbl(con, "activities") |>
    collect()  # This command reads the data from the DB into memory
```

```

You can use standard `tidyverse` functions on the database connection before you load it into R with `collect`, i.e. if I want to find all my long runs from Summer 2020 I could do the following:

```r
tbl(con, "activities") |>
    filter(
      start_time >= '2020-05-01', 
      start_time < '2020-09-01',
      distance > 20,
      activity_type == 'Run'
    ) |>
    arrange(desc(distance)) |>
    collect() 
```

```

**NB: When you are finished with the database, close the connection and shut it down!**

```r
dbDisconnect(con, shutdown=TRUE)
```

## Installation

Simply clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stulacy/StravaR) (from within RStudio, File -\> New Project -\> Version Control -\> Git, then enter `https://github.com/stulacy/StravaR.git` as the Repository URL), then install any missing packages that are loaded in `server.R` (RStudio should highlight these).
You can then run the app in a web browser by opening `app.R`, clicking the arrow next to Run App and selecting Run External, and then clicking Run App.
On first use it will create the database, prompt you to enter details about yourself, and prompt for a Strava archive file.

## Extending the app

Feel free to modify the source code to your heart's content to meet your specific needs.
If you come up with any interesting visualisations or models please let me know - I'd be interested to see what people get up to!
