Today I gave a talk introducing Python to early stage researchers in my Department. It's always hard deciding what material to include in an hour's talk, particularly when the subject material is so vast. This wasn't helped by the fact that in my department there is a large range of programming experience, from researchers with backgrounds in Computer Science to Electronic Engineers who are only comfortable with Matlab. I attempted to address both of these groups by introducing Python as a language in terms of its syntax, data structures and control flow, before discussing how you can emulate Matlab by using the SciPy stack.

It received positive feedback so I thought I'd put it online [(download slides here)](/downloads/slacy_ecrfpython_20150707.pdf) in case anyone is interested in a very shallow overview of why Python is a useful language to learn these days, particularly in the Scientific Research community, and also practical tips for starting to use it.
