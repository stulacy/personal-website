abstract = "Ensembles are groups of classifiers which cooperate in order to reach a decision. Conventionally, the members of an ensemble are trained sequentially, and typically independently, and are not brought together until the final stages of ensemble generation. In this paper, we discuss the potential benefits of training classifiers together, so that they learn to interact at an early stage of their development. As a potential mechanism for achieving this, we consider the biological concept of mutualism, whereby cooperation emerges over the course of biological evolution. We also discuss potential mechanisms for implementing this approach within an evolutionary algorithm context"
