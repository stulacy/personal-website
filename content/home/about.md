# Biography

I'm a Research Fellow in the Epidemiology and Cancer Statistics Group at the University of York. My research is focused on applying machine learning techniques to health informatics; I'm currently working on developing complex predictive survival and multi-state models of haematological malignancies. I have an interest in software development, and in particular developing statistical tools such as packages for R. I also dabble in sports statistics, such as predicting the outcome of matches.
