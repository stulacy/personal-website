# Biography

I'm a data scientist interested in applying machine learning to some of the biggest challenges facing society.
In my current role I work on high resolution air quality measurements recorded from low-cost sensors using a combination of deep learning and Bayesian statistics.
Previously I have applied machine learning to form complex survival models of haematological malignancies and analysed movement disorder data from neurodegenerative conditions.
I also have an interest in software development, and in particular developing tools for others to use, such as statistical packages in R and interactive dashboards.
My main tools are R, probabilistic machine learning in Stan, and PyTorch.
